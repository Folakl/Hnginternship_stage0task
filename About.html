      <p>
        <span class="name">Yakub Roimot Omotara</span> — Frontend developer focused on clean, usable interfaces. 
        I build responsive web pages with tools like npm, Vite, and Supabase. 
        I enjoy implementing Figma designs and integrating practical features such as authentication, 
        routing, and form validation.
